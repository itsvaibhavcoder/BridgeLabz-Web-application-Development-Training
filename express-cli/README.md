# Express API CLI

The **Express API CLI** is a command-line tool used to quickly scaffold and set up Express.js projects. It streamlines the process of creating a boilerplate for building RESTful APIs using the Express.js framework. The CLI can generate necessary project files and configurations, allowing developers to start building their applications faster without having to manually set up the directory structure and boilerplate code.

## Key Features:
1. **Quick Project Setup**: It creates the basic structure of an Express project, including folders for routes, middleware, controllers, and more.
2. **Built-in Features**: It often includes basic middleware, such as for logging, body parsing, and error handling.
3. **Customization**: Depending on the CLI, you might be able to customize what gets included in your initial setup, such as database integrations or authentication features.
4. **Best Practices**: The generated code typically follows industry best practices, making it easier to maintain and scale your application.

## Example of Using an Express API CLI:
While the original Express.js CLI (`express-generator`) is a common tool, there are others that might provide additional features. Here’s how you might use the `express-generator`:

### 1. Install the CLI:
   ```bash
   npm install -g express-generator
   ```

### 2. Generate a New Project:
   ```bash
   express my-api-project
   ```

   This will create a new directory `my-api-project` with a basic structure for an Express application.

### 3. Install Dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd my-api-project
   npm install
   ```

### 4. Run the Server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

### 5. Project Structure:
   After running the generator, your project might look like this:
   ```
   my-api-project/
   ├── app.js
   ├── bin/
   │   └── www
   ├── package.json
   ├── public/
   ├── routes/
   │   ├── index.js
   │   └── users.js
   ├── views/
   │   ├── error.jade
   │   ├── index.jade
   │   └── layout.jade
   └── node_modules/
   ```

## Conclusion:
The Express API CLI simplifies the initial setup process of an Express.js project, allowing developers to focus on building the API logic rather than spending time configuring the project structure from scratch.
