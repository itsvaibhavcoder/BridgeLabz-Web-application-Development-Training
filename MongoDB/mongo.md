# MVC Architecture

MVC is a software architectural pattern used for developing user interfaces. It divides an application into interconnected components.

## Components

### Model
- Represents the data and the business logic of the application.

### View
- Displays the data to the user.
- Sends user commands to the controller.

### Controller
- Acts as an intermediary between the model and the view.
- Takes user input from the view, processes it (using the model), and updates the view accordingly.

## HTTP Methods

HTTP methods are used to perform different actions on resources identified by URLs in RESTful APIs. The most commonly used HTTP methods are:

- **GET**: Retrieves data from a resource without changing it.
- **POST**: Submits data to the server to create a new resource.
- **PUT**: Updates an existing resource or creates a new one if it does not exist.
- **DELETE**: Deletes a specific resource.
- **PATCH**: Applies partial modifications to a resource.
- **HEAD**: Similar to GET, but only retrieves the headers.
- **OPTIONS**: Describes the communication options for the target resource.
