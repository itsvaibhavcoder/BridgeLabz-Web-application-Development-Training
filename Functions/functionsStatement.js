//Function Statement (Declaration): Functions declared using the function keyword are called function statements or function declarations. They are hoisted to the top of their scope.

function subtract(a,b){
    return a-b;
}
console.log(subtract(10,4));

//Hoisting: Function declarations are hoisted, meaning they can be called before their declaration in the code.
